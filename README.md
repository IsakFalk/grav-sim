grav-sim
========

A crude simulator of a solar system. The idea is to use the verlet integration method to update the planets at each time- step. Haven't included the planets force on eachother as I don't know how to model the that, will try to update in the future. Several options are possible, such as tracing out the path by keeping all the dots on the screen, or trun it off so the planet moves regularly.
