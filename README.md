grav-sim
========

A crude simulator of a solar system. The idea is to use the verlet integration method to update the planets at each time- step. Haven't included the planets force on each other as I don't know how to model it. Will try to update in the future. Several options are possible, such as tracing out the path by keeping all the dots on the screen, or trun it off so the planet moves regularly. Would like to implement a main function so you don't have to create specific objects of the planet, sun, leapfrog etc class by yourself, but just run the script.
